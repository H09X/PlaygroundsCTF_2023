Description:
Assemble the mysterious message hidden within the code.

We are provided with 1 line of c code

int main(){  int VWlkfGJ3an;  BrYXZGUUN+(TTUxXVo0dl);  return 0;}int pnYDJxQHda(int Mk1kS1pfbG){  return RhdnF3eA==^5;}

and the description indicates that there is a hidden message in this code.

Looking at this code. we notice some really weird strings and they all have 1 thing in common.
The length of all the strings is 10 which means that maybe this is a message that got disassembled.

lets try to assemble these strings to see what we get:

VWlkfGJ3anBrYXZGUUN+TTUxXVo0dlpnYDJxQHdaMk1kS1pfbGRhdnF3eA==

Looks like a base64 to me but let’s try to use a tool like cyberchef to make sure.
Cyberchef confirms it’s a base64 but when we try to decode we get an unreadable text lets look at the code again maybe me missed something.

If we remove the weird strings from the code the only thing remaining is ^5 which indicates that the message is xored with 5 
Lets try to xor the decoded base64 message with 5.

and we get the flag: 
PlaygroundsCTF{H04X_1s_be7tEr_7HaN_Ziadstr}
